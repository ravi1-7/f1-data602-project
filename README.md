## Topic: Formula 1

Formula 1 (F1) is the world’s leading motorsport, blending advanced technology and elite driver skill in races held globally. Since its debut in 1950, F1 has drawn millions of fans through its dramatic Grand Prix events and technical innovation. The sport features engineering marvels—single-seater cars reaching extraordinary speeds on diverse circuits from Monaco to Silverstone. With over 826 million global followers in 2025, F1 is a prime example of big data and real-time analytics in action. Integrating Formula 1 data into machine learning projects enables powerful insights into strategy, performance, and predictive modeling


## Project: Podium Predictor

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a driver will finish on the podium (in the top 3) in a Formula 1 Grand Prix. By analyzing historical race data, the model aims to identify the key factors that contribute to a successful race outcome.
